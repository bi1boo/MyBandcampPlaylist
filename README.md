# Bandcamp Listen List
Bandcamp Listening List Chrome extension

Bandcamp Listening List is a simple chrome extension that lets you build a Listening List in your browser as you dig through Bandcamp so you can listen as you go. 

How to install:

1. Download the package above. 
2. Navigate to "Extensions" in your Chrome browser. 
3. In the top right toggle on "Developer Mode"
4. Select "Load Unpacked" and select the downloaded folder. 
5. Should be ready to use!

How to use:

- Pin the extenstion to your taskbar.
- As you browse Bandcamp, open the extenstion and select "Add" to add the release you're currently viewing to the Listen List.
- Select "Clear" to clear your Listen List.
- Select "Open Player" to open the list as a seperate browser window. 

** Notes ** 

- The pop out player doesn't automatically update, you'll need to select "Refresh" when you add new tracks to update the player. 
- The extension currently only supports adding releases, or stand alone tracks. Tracks that are part of a full release won't work. 
- The in browser popup will only show one track from a release, if you want to listen to the full release open the popout player and that will have the full tracklist. 

Next Improvements:

- Support adding tracks from within releases.
